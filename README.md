# `Sage` (_Chronicle_)

> **A local-first, event-sourced developer cognition engine for capturing decisions, reasoning, and meaning over time.**

`Sage` captures not just _what_ you did—but **why** you did it.

It is a time-aware personal system for developers who want to preserve context, reasoning, and conceptual understanding over time.

Quick install (release binary):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/divijg19/sage/main/install.sh | bash
```

---

## Why `Sage`?

Code remembers _changes_.  
Task managers remember _intent_.  
Logs remember _events_.

**None remember reasoning.**

After weeks or months, developers inevitably ask:

- _Why did we choose this approach?_
- _What problem was this solving?_
- _What alternatives were rejected?_
- _What changed my mind?_

`Sage` exists to answer those questions—**locally, permanently, and without friction**.

---

## What Is `Sage`?

`Sage` is a **local-first CLI developer cognition engine** that records work as immutable events.

The CLI is the source of truth today. More derived “cognition layers” (graphs, relationships, projections) are planned later, but the event log remains primary.

Think:

> **Git + journaling + event sourcing + semantic context — for humans.**

---

## Core Principles

- **Local-first** — No cloud, no accounts, no telemetry
- **Append-only** — History is immutable
- **Time-aware** — Past state can be reconstructed
- **Derived meaning** — Graphs are projections, not truth
- **Low-friction** — Designed for daily use
- **Human-centric** — Built for reasoning, not metrics

---

## Current CLI + Chronicle

Sage is intentionally editor-centric and calm.

### Add an entry (2-step flow)

Step 1: provide a title (arg or prompt).  
Step 2: your editor opens with a prefilled template (including a `title:` field).  
Save and close to return to the CLI, then confirm to append the entry.

Notes:

- If you don’t explicitly choose record/decision, Sage will ask.
- Exit the editor without saving to cancel.

Sage also protects you from accidental noise:

- If you close the editor without making meaningful changes, nothing is saved.
- If the content is semantically empty (headings-only / boilerplate-only), nothing is saved.
- If you accidentally repeat the exact same entry (same kind/title/content/tags), nothing is saved.

```bash
# Record
sage add "Investigate flaky CI on linux"

# Add tags (repeatable or comma-separated)
sage add "Fix OAuth callback" --tags auth,backend
sage add "Refactor DB adapter" --tags db --tags cleanup

# Decision (quick shorthand)
sage add d "Use SQLite WAL mode"

# Or via flag
sage add --decision "Switch to Go toolchain 1.23"
```

**Editor setup**

Sage uses a configurable editor command.

Precedence:

1) `sage editor ...` (stored in `~/.sage/config.json`)
2) `$SAGE_EDITOR`
3) `$EDITOR`

Recommended: set it once via `sage editor`.

For VS Code:

```bash
sage editor code --wait
```

If you use a GUI editor, it must **block until the file is closed** (for `code`, that means `--wait`).

Sage will automatically add `--wait` if your editor is VS Code (`code`/`codium`) and you forgot it, but setting it explicitly is recommended.

### Templates

Templates are loaded from:

```text
~/.sage/templates/*.md
```

Use a template by **name**:

```bash
sage add --template decision "Add structured decision notes"
```

Or by **numeric ID** (1-based, sorted by filename; no quotes needed):

```bash
sage add --template 1 "Use template #1"
```

If you prefer selecting interactively:

```bash
sage add --choose-template "Pick a template"
```

Sage automatically strips YAML front matter (like `title:` / `kind:`) from stored content, and it won’t save entries that are unchanged boilerplate or semantically empty.

### Timeline filtering

```bash
sage timeline --tags auth
sage timeline --tags auth,backend
sage timeline --all
sage timeline --project myapp
```

Timeline output includes a **numeric entry ID** (the first bracket). Use it with:

```bash
sage view 42
```

### View past entries

```bash
sage view 42
```

This prints the full entry (timestamp, kind, title, tags, content).

If the entry belongs to a project, `sage view` prints `Project: <name>`.

### Tags

Tags are optional strings used for filtering and finding entries.

```bash
# List tags + counts
sage tag

# Scope by project (optional)
sage tag --project myapp
sage tag --all

# Tag an entry id with a tag (comma-separated supported)
sage tag 42 "auth"
sage tag 42 "auth,backend"

# Show all entries with a tag
sage tag "auth"
```

### State reconstruction

```bash
sage state --at 2026-01-09
sage state --at 2026-01-09T21:30
sage state --at 2026-01-09 --project myapp
sage state --at 2026-01-09 --all
```

---

## Key Capabilities

### 🧾 Event-Sourced Timeline (Source of Truth)

All entries are stored as events (entry content is append-only; tags are optional metadata for filtering):

- decisions
- notes
- experiments
- reflections
- outcomes

Today, the CLI focuses on reliable capture and trustworthy summaries.

Every event is timestamped, durable, and replayable.

### 🧠 Derived Cognition (Planned)

From the event log, `Sage` can eventually build a **local semantic graph** of:

- **Concepts** (e.g. `auth`, `postgres`, `event-sourcing`)
- **Decisions** (explicit architectural or technical choices)
- **Artifacts** (modules, files, repos, docs)
- **Relationships** (`affects`, `depends_on`, `supersedes`, `references`)

> **Events are the source of truth.  
> The graph is a projection.**

This ensures:

- explainability
- reversibility
- time-aware reasoning
- zero hallucination

---

### ⚡ `Sage` CLI

Minimal, editor-first commands:

```bash
sage add "Refactored auth middleware" --tags auth,backend
sage add d "Use Go instead of Node for websocket server" --tags backend
sage timeline
sage timeline --tags auth
sage state --at 2026-01-09
```

---

### 🧠 Time-Travel Introspection

Ask questions of the past:

```bash
sage state --at 2025-01-10
```

`Sage` reconstructs:

- decisions made
- notes taken
- relevant context at that moment

All answers link back to concrete events.

---

### 📁 Global Journal

All entries live in a single, local-only store:

```
~/.sage/
├── sage.db
├── config.json
└── templates/*.md
```

If you have older per-directory stores from previous versions, Sage will import them into the global store the first time the global store is empty.

---

### 📦 Projects (Optional)

Sage defaults to a global view across all entries. Projects are an optional scope you can activate in your shell (like a Python venv):

```bash
# bash/zsh
eval "$(sage projects activate myapp)"

# fish
sage projects activate myapp --shell fish | source
```

When a project is active, these commands default to that scope:

- `sage add`
- `sage timeline`
- `sage state`
- `sage tag` (listing/showing)

`sage view <id>` is always global by numeric ID.

To see your current scope:

```bash
sage projects current
```

---

### 🖥️ Chronicle TUI

Chronicle is available today through:

```bash
sage tui
```

Chronicle reuses the same global event store and add-flow rules as the rest of the CLI, but presents them as a keyboard-first home screen with:

- a `Chronicle` header and project-aware scope summary
- a day-grouped timeline with expandable entries
- basic search across title, content, tags, project, and kind
- filter controls for project, kind, and tags
- a quick-entry drawer that seeds the note and then opens your configured editor

Useful keys:

- `j` / `k` or arrow keys to move
- `Enter` / `Space` to expand entries or collapse day groups
- `/` to focus search
- `f` to open filters
- `n` to start a quick entry
- `r` to reload
- `Tab` to toggle the preview drawer on narrow terminals
- `Esc` to close the active drawer/input
- `q` to quit

---

### 🔗 Git Hooks

Sage can install a safe `post-commit` hook that records a lightweight commit event into your global log.

```bash
# Install into the current repo (backs up/chains existing hooks)
sage hooks install

# Check status
sage hooks status

# Uninstall (restores legacy hook if it was backed up)
sage hooks uninstall
```

Hook behavior:

- Never blocks commits (best-effort, always exits 0)
- Default is non-blocking background execution
- If you prefer synchronous execution: `sage hooks install --sync`

---

## Example Event

```json
{
  "id": "evt_20250302_2141",
  "timestamp": "2025-03-02T21:41:00Z",
  "project": "nargis",
  "kind": "decision",
  "title": "Use Postgres instead of Redis",
  "tags": ["backend", "storage"],
  "content": "Switched from Redis to Postgres due to durability and query needs."
}
```

---

## Architecture Overview

- **Language:** Go
- **Core Model:** Event sourcing (append-only log)
- **Derived Model:** Planned (rebuildable projections)
- **Storage:** SQLite
- **Interfaces:** CLI (default)
- **Scope:** Global by default (optional project scope)

`Sage` intentionally avoids:

- mutable global state
- remote sync
- proprietary formats
- opaque inference

---

## Installation

Install from source:

```bash
go install github.com/divijg19/sage@latest
```
Useful installer options:

```bash
./install.sh --version v0.7.0
./install.sh --bin-dir "$HOME/.local/bin"
./install.sh --enable-chronicle-alias --shell bash
```

The optional Chronicle alias is installed as a shell function:

```bash
chronicle() {
  sage tui "$@"
}
```

This is intentionally a shell function instead of a symlink so `chronicle` can always route to `sage tui` without changing the binary's command parsing.

Release builds are published by `.github/workflows/release.yml` for:

- `linux/amd64`
- `linux/arm64`
- `darwin/amd64`
- `darwin/arm64`
- `windows/amd64`

## What’s Still Missing (v0.1–v0.5)

Everything in v0.1–v0.5 is usable daily, but there are still a few “sharp edges” that should be addressed before calling it truly hardened.

- **Migration safety:** the store migration path should be transactional/fail-loud (and covered by regression tests) so data can’t be dropped on partial failures.
- **SQLite robustness:** consider a busy timeout / WAL tuning so concurrent readers (timeline/state) + writers (hooks) don’t cause sporadic failures.
- **Non-interactive UX:** commands that prompt should have clear behavior when stdin isn’t a TTY (flags-only mode, or a friendly error).
- **Observability:** a lightweight `sage doctor`/healthcheck-style command (or status output) would make failures easier to debug.
- **Hooks hardening:** ensure hook execution is resilient across odd repo setups (custom hooks path, detached HEAD, unusual `PWD`).

---

## Test Strategy

Sage is deliberately small; the goal is tight tests around correctness and “no surprises” UX.

- **Unit tests** (fast, pure helpers)
  - tag parsing/normalization
  - project scope precedence (`SAGE_PROJECT`, `--project`, `--all`)
  - timeline/view formatting rules (IDs, timestamps, tag display)
- **Regression tests** (lock in behaviors that must never change)
  - “no-op” editor exits don’t write entries
  - dedupe against latest entry (scoped by project)
  - hook install/uninstall is idempotent and preserves legacy hooks
  - store migrations are idempotent and stable-order
- **Integration tests** (realistic IO)
  - sqlite open/migrate on temp DB
  - hook script execution in a temp git repo
  - editor invocation via a fake script on PATH

---

## CI

This repo includes a GitHub Actions workflow that runs on every push/PR:

- `gofmt` check
- `go vet ./...`
- `go test ./...`
- `go test -race ./...`

See [.github/workflows/ci.yml](.github/workflows/ci.yml).

---

## Philosophy

`Sage` treats **developer cognition** as a first-class artifact.

Code changes, understanding compounds. `Sage` preserves the latter.

Building developer understanding is compounding on your choices, and `Sage` seeks to preserve this.

---

## Non-Goals

`Sage` is **not**:

- a task manager
- a note-taking app
- a Git replacement
- a cloud service

It complements existing tools—it does not replace them.

---

## Contributing

`Sage` is opinionated by design.

Before contributing:

- understand the local-first philosophy
- respect immutability
- avoid feature creep

Open an issue before major changes.
